<p>An application/tool created to the carrier and distributors of a company with an ERP where the allocation of orders to those carriers/distributors previously recorded. It aims to create optimized routes based on postal addresses of orders, and also record the process of delivering them.<br /><br />

   In the list of routes, as mentioned above, each route has an address of \"source\" and \"target\"; the first route is to source address \"My Location\" that is obtained from the GPS device; this will also be the destination address on the final route. Each route different orders associated with the destination address, except the last path are added.<br /><br />
